# Code of Conduct — ai-movie-studio

We value a welcoming, inclusive, and safe community. This Code of Conduct applies to all contributors, maintainers, and participants in `ai-movie-studio` activities (issues, pull requests, discussions, chat, events).

## Our standards

We ask everyone to:
- Be respectful and considerate in language and behavior.  
- Assume good faith and give constructive, actionable feedback.  
- Respect local laws, cultural sensitivities, and the dignity of others.  
- Avoid harassment, hateful language, and abusive conduct.

### Unacceptable behavior includes (but is not limited to):
- Personal attacks, harassment, or hateful remarks based on protected characteristics (race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc.).
- Posting or promoting sexual or violent content that is not clearly marked and contextually necessary (for example, examples in `examples/` must include content warnings).  
- Sharing private personal information (doxing) or private credentials.  
- Targeted and repeated harassment of a contributor.

## Scope

This policy applies to behavior in the repository, issue tracker, PRs, Discussions, community forums, chat channels, and project events.

## Reporting & enforcement

If you experience or witness a violation, please report it to the maintainers **privately** at `conduct@your-org.example` (replace with the real address) or open an issue with the label `conduct` and set it to private if your platform supports that. Reports should include:
- A short description of the event and why it violates the Code.  
- Links or screenshots (when possible).  
- The usernames of involved parties and a best contact method.

All reports will be reviewed by the project maintainers. We will treat reports seriously and will investigate in a timely, confidential manner. Possible outcomes include a private warning, temporary or permanent ban from the repository or community spaces, and referral to platform administrators if necessary.

## Moderation & transparency

- Moderators will document enforcement actions privately with a short rationale to preserve privacy.  
- Non-identifying summaries of enforcement (numbers and high-level reasons) may be published quarterly to maintain community trust.

## Help & clarifications

If you have questions about this policy or suggested improvements, please open an issue labeled `meta` or contact the maintainers directly at `conduct@your-org.example`.
