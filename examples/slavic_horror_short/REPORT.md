# REPORT — examples/slavic_horror_short

Project: Village of Ashes
Created: 2025-12-23
Author: ai-movie-studio examples team

## Overview
A compact, end-to-end demo that uses the repo's script_dev → previs → visuals → audio pipelines to produce a ~12-minute Slavic-horror short. This example is intentionally conservative on compute and uses stylized visuals + layered audio to achieve a slow-burn, folklore-rooted tone.

## Goals
- Demonstrate repeatable pipeline artifacts: `script.fountain`, `shotlist.csv`, storyboards, an animatic MP4, renders, and audio stems.  
- Show provenance: model names (placeholder), prompts, seeds, and human curation steps.  
- Provide an example `project.yaml` that can be used for CI smoke tests.

## Artifacts (expected)
- `project.yaml` (this file)
- `script.fountain` (generated by `pipeline/script_dev/`)  
- `shotlist.csv` (generated by `pipeline/previs/`)  
- `storyboard/scene_##/shot_##.png`  
- `animatic/scene_##.mp4`  
- `renders/scene_##/shot_##.*`  
- `audio/voice/*.wav`, `audio/sfx/*.wav`, `audio/music/stems/*.wav`  
- `REPORT.md` (this document)

## Models & Prompts (record inputs here)
- Script model: `text-model-placeholder` — prompt: `prompts/genres/slavic_horror/scene_seed.md` — seed: 42
- Visual model: `video-model-placeholder` — scene_config: `templates/scene_config.yaml` — render settings: guidance_scale=7.5, steps=20
- Audio model(s): voice preset `villager_elder` (TTS placeholder), SFX packs: `wind_forest`, `underground_drone`

> Replace placeholder model names with exact model identifiers and versions before publishing artifacts.

## Human interventions
- Script selection: human curated top logline and edited outline to tighten pacing.  
- Storyboard curation: artist tweaked AI-generated frames for continuity and clarity.  
- Audio mix: human adjusted FX chain and compression for final stems.  

Document each intervention in the artifact sidecars (e.g., `storyboard/scene_01/shot_01.metadata.json`) listing who approved, summary of edits, and timestamp.

## Timeline (estimates)
- Script dev: 30–60 minutes (iterative prompts + human edit).  
- Previs (shot planning + stubs): 1–2 hours.  
- Visuals (generations and passes): variable (30 min – several hours per scene depending on model).  
- Audio (TTS + SFX + music stems): 1–3 hours.

## Safety & Cultural Review
- This project includes folklore elements and potentially distressing imagery: **culture review required** (see `docs/HORROR_SPECIALIZATION.md`).  
- Content warnings: mature themes, disturbing imagery. Add runtime warnings when sharing externally.

## How to reproduce (example)
1. Ensure required keys and environment variables are set (see `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`).  
2. Run stage-by-stage (or `--stage full` if available):

```bash
python scripts/cli.py run \
  --project examples/slavic_horror_short/project.yaml \
  --stage script_dev
python scripts/cli.py run --project examples/slavic_horror_short/project.yaml --stage previs
# etc.
```

3. Inspect artifacts under `examples/slavic_horror_short/` and add `metadata.json` sidecars for any curated artifacts.

## Notes & next steps
- Replace placeholder model identifiers with exact model names and versions and update this `REPORT.md`.  
- Add a small smoke test to CI that runs `script_dev` stage and verifies `script.fountain` is created.  
- Add content warning templates to the `REPORT.md` when final content is exported for distribution.

## Attributions & license
- This example is licensed per repository `LICENSE` (suggested: Apache-2.0).  
- List of used third-party tools/models should be added to `THIRD_PARTY.md` with links and license notes.
